# Juniper Cocktails Customer Feedback Application

Juniper Cocktails is an imaginary chain of cocktail bar's operating at various locations across the UK.

The main purpose of this application is to allow a user (usually a staff member at one of Juniper Cocktails venues) to input customer feedback that will be recorded on a Google sheets feedback worksheet.  This feedback could be input in real-time by asking the customer specific questions while at the venue, or could be gathered and input from a paper-based survey completed by the customer before leaving the venue.

The secondary purpose of the application is to allow user's at the venue (particularly a manager or franchisee owner) to analyse the feedback for their venue and compare it to feedback from other venue's in order to gain insights into what improvements could be made at their venue.

Juniper Cocktails would like to maintain a certain level of consistency across their venues and the aim of this application is to allow franchisee owners or managers to input customer feedback and compare their feedback with the feedback from other venues.  This will allow owners or managers to ensure they are maintaining their feedback scores at an appropriate level, and improve upon underperforming areas where needed.  Use of this application by venues will also allow other Juniper Cocktails stakeholders (e.g. area manager's) to examine and analyse feedback via the Google Sheets worksheets.
